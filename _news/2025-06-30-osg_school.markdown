From June 23–27, I participated the [OSG School 2025](https://osg-htc.org/school-2025/) in Madison—a week of inspiring conversations and a hands-on dive into high-throughput computing (HTC). It was great to connect with researchers who share similar challenges and creative HTC applications, all within a program that felt both practical and lively. Huge thanks to [UW-Madison CHTC](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/) and the organizers for making this experience so welcoming and enriching.
