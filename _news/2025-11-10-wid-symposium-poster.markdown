I presented my poster at on behalf our lab at the [15th WID Annual Symposium](https://go.wisc.edu/widsymposium25). The [poster](/assets/work/2025/wid_symposium_poster_2025.pdf) included our recent work on development of false postive control technique using Knockoff+ for neural decoding with Iterated LASSO.
