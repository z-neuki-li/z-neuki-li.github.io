I'm Neuki (Zihan Li, 李子晗), a PhD student in the [Department of Psychology at UW-Madison](https://psych.wisc.edu/), advised by Dr. Tim Rogers. 

I work with my fantastic colleagues in the [Knowledge and Concepts Lab](http://concepts.psych.wisc.edu/) focusing on the construction of decoding models applied to reveal the neural representations of semantic knowledge in human brain. In parallel, I explore interactions with large language models (LLMs), investigating how their behaviors emerge when prompted with contextual data from human participants.

Before navigating inward to human mind, I gazed outward to the universe. I completed my undergraduate study in the [School of Astronomy and Space Science at Nanjing University](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN), where I was supervised by Dr. Bin-bin Zhang working on the analysis of quasi-periodic phenomena of Gamma-ray bursts.
